# How to create your own video

This tutorial wil take you through all the steps needed to create a video like the one linked in the [youtube-samples](/youtube-samples) section

## Hardware requirements

1. A video camera
2. HR measurment device with 1s resolution

The sample videos have been recorded using GoPro Hero 7 Black and HR has been measured using [Polar H10 chest strap](https://www.polar.com/en/sensors/h10-heart-rate-sensor)

**Polar H10 is as good as it gets and is recommended for the most accurate measurments**

If you wonder why the HR readings from the watch is not good enough, check out [The Quantified Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/@TheQuantifiedScientist/videos) youtube channel for more information
